# Project Title
The section will contain the demo video. In order to embed your video in the README as well as our docs, you need to do the following:
1. Drag the drop the video in the README. Doing that will generate a link for your video. Convert the link to a href by writing it in this format \[demo](<generated_link>). Checkout this [example](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/Unify/LLM-Wars/README.md?plain=1#L2) incase you're not sure what to do.
2. Add your video the [Video](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/tree/main/videos) folder with the name <project_name>.mp4. And add the following lines to your README:
```
<video width="640" height="480" autoplay>
  <source src="../../../../_static/<project_name>.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
Incase the above is confusing, checkout this [example](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/Unify/LLM-Wars/README.md?plain=1#L4C1-L7C9)

###  Overview
This Streamlit application provides a user interface for interacting with Unify models through the chat. It allows users to select models and providers, input text, and view the conversation history with two AI assistants at a time. The app collects the data on the users' assessment of the comparative models' performance and provides an easy access to the global leaderboards which can be used as a complementary form of assessment of the performance of the models.


### Motivation
The challenge project "Chatbot arena" is based on [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132).
